This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

## Database (Firestore)

This project saves parsed card entries from the top page to Google Cloud Firestore.

1. Set Firebase configuration in your environment variables (.env.development.local for local dev).
2. Ensure your Firebase project is set up with Firestore enabled.
3. Configure authentication (service account for development, Workload Identity for production).

On submit, the app calls POST /api/cards and performs batch operations to save all parsed entries to Firestore collections.

## Code Formatting (Prettier)

This project uses [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code formatting.

- Format all files:

```bash
npm run format
# or
yarn format
```

- Check formatting without writing changes:

```bash
npm run format:check
# or
yarn format:check
```
